# Portfolio is such a big word

## Consolidate not complicate

I have made previous attempts at pulling together a portfolio and got distracted  heading down rabbit holes or diving back in to finish earlier projects. But not this time, this time I have a plan (ha ha).

Seriously, there is a plan. 

	- Collect up a listing of all the courses I have subscribed to, started, finished or otherwise engaged with. 
	- Report on the current status of the courses and learnings achieved
	- Make a workplace for finishing out only the elements I will find useful in the courses as with some of them I’ve already got out of them as much as I’m going to get.
	- Compile case studies which demonstrate the learned elements
	- Build a draft version by reading week
	- And this is the big one, **don’t start** any new stuff until its done.

## Cadence and accountability

The other key elects to success are a regular cadence of work and some level of accountability. I therefore propose to ring fence off time on Wednesday and Thursday usually dedicated to ceramics and art to execute the project and every 2nd  Thursday take 30mins to report on project progress in the 2 week slot. 

## Obstacles to success

	- Organization. The work to date is scattered everywhere and there are multiple copies. Session 1 is going to be dedicated to pulling all the information together into one place and creating an index of the work and a tracking page for each. This will be done in Apple Notes to avoid the rabbit hole of setting up al sorts of elaborate  systems
	- Consistent workflows. Having a slick and consistent workflow to publish work but one that is easy to maintain and docent become the project itself. Publication of progress should take no more than 30 min every two weeks
	- Distraction. Oh look a new shiny thing!

Edit: Workflow 1 sorted and I have got Ulysses posting to the blog and sorted out all my Wordpress logins and payments.
