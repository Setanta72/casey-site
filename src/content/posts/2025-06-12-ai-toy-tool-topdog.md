## A naive assessment of how great AI is

The tool presented here was developed by Gemini on my instruction to create a scale of the users perception of the stage they are at with regards to integrating generative AI into their research practice. This is a simple visual aid to a presentation in which I expound the naively positive perspective on the use of AI in academic research. 


### The Tool

Try out the tool here:

[AI in Research Spectrum]({{ '/Webapps/Toy2Lead.html' | relative_url }})


### The Commentary
The tool, written by Gemini, follows my basic input to outline the kind of stages of where an AI could be used in interacting with our research. The designations and examples are fairly arbitrary and  illustrative only. The tool only presents a positive view of the possible interaction (as was by brief)

My own usage is actually shifted quite foar right on this scale and even inn its current form the tool could prove a useful way to inform the ongoing discussion of AI in research. 

### Further Work
We could consider making a more robust set of criteria and validate the scale. We could then attach this to a backend that captures input from the user. Could be a useful self assessment tool for researchers. 

A similar scale tool might also be useful for setting undergraduate use of AI in assignments.
