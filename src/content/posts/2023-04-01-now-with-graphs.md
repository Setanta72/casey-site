## Project planning with GPT-4

Using D4.js and html+css I was able to prompt GPT-4 to plan a project and then plot a rudimentary Gantt. It is easy to see how this could be integrated into a project planning tool and how using the LLM dependencies could be established automatically.

Combine this with the ability to generate reasonable drafts of work breakdown structures in a similar manner of the mind mapping in a previous post then the power of GPT-4 as a planning tool becomes obvious.

Similar to a real PhD researcher it seems to have a pretty flexible idea as to how long 4 years is, but listen it wouldnt be the first of us to fall into that trap.
