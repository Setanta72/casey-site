# ObsLite v2.2 Release Notes

## Overview
ObsLite v2.2 brings HTML export functionality and important cross-platform compatibility fixes. This release focuses on making the app work seamlessly across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## New Features

### HTML Export
- **Export notes to HTML** with a single click via the new Export button in the toolbar
- Exported HTML files include styled formatting that mirrors the preview appearance
- Clean, print-ready CSS with proper heading styles, code blocks, blockquotes, and table formatting
- Standalone HTML files that can be opened in any browser or shared easily

## Bug Fixes

### Cross-Platform New Note Creation
- **Fixed:** Creating new notes now works on macOS
- The browser's native `prompt()` dialog doesn't function within Tauri's WebView on Mac
- Replaced with a custom modal dialog that works consistently across all platforms
- Modal supports keyboard navigation (Enter to create, Escape to cancel)

### Removed Non-Functional Print Button
- The Print button has been removed as it wasn't providing value
- WebView security restrictions prevented the print dialog from working reliably
- Users can export to HTML and print from their browser for better results

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Svelte with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Rust with Tauri 2.x
- **Platforms:** macOS, Windows, Linux (including Raspberry Pi)
