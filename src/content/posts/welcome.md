After years of scattered content across various platforms, I'm consolidating everything here.

This site will be home to:
- **Photography** - including my camera collection and alternative process work
- **Ceramics** - documenting pieces and processes
- **Art** - drawings, paintings, and design work
- **Code** - programming projects and explorations
- **Making** - 3D printing, physical computing, and tinkering
- **Research** - design methods and opinion pieces

The goal is simple: one place for everything, easy to update, and backed up locally.

More to come as I migrate content over.
