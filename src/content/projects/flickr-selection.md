A selection of 70 photographs from my years on Flickr, organized into seven themes:

- **Irish Landscapes** - The coastlines, towns, and countryside of Ireland
- **Street/Urban** - Buildings, doors, and urban details
- **Nature/Macro** - Close-up work with flowers, insects, and natural textures
- **Camera Gear** - The tools of the trade, old and new
- **Travel** - Arizona, Berlin, and places beyond Ireland
- **Portraits** - Faces and characters
- **Miscellaneous** - Everything else worth keeping

These images span from 2012 to 2018, shot on a mix of digital and film cameras including Fuji X100, Yashica FX-D, Rolleiflex, various Agfa folders, and Diana F+.
