This project documents the development of a "Copper Coast Ceramics" single-page website through iterative collaboration between human direction and multiple Artificial Intelligence systems.

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Asset Creation

AI image generation (GPT-4o) was used to create logo concepts derived from Copper Coast photography. The landscape itself informed the color palette:

- `#FDFBF5` — Cream
- `#586464` — Dark teal
- `#7C9393` — Mid teal
- `#9EB0B0` — Light teal
- `#E9EAE5` — Off-white

Product photography was organized and the hero image created via AI integration of the logo into a ceramic photograph.

### Phase 2: Initial Website Generation

Gemini AI was tasked with creating a responsive site with About, Gallery, and Contact sections. Tailwind CSS styling was applied via CDN, with a Lightbox gallery implementation based on prior validated code.

### Phase 3: Iterative Refinement

The AI-generated code required several rounds of adjustment:
- Hero background path corrections
- Logo sizing adjustments
- Gallery aspect-ratio modifications from square to 16/9

### Phase 4: Deployment

Formspree was integrated for contact form handling and the site was hosted on GitHub Pages via Jekyll.

## Reflections

This project demonstrates how AI can accelerate the design and development process when guided by clear human direction. The iterative refinement phase shows that AI-generated code often needs adjustment, but the overall workflow significantly reduced development time.
