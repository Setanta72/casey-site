This project documents the development of a "Copper Coast Ceramics" single-page website through iterative collaboration between human direction and multiple Artificial Intelligence systems.

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Asset Creation

- AI image generation (GPT-4o) for logo concepts derived from Copper Coast photography
- Color palette established from the landscape:
  - `#FDFBF5` - Cream
  - `#586464` - Dark teal
  - `#7C9393` - Mid teal
  - `#9EB0B0` - Light teal
  - `#E9EAE5` - Off-white
- Product photography organized (CC1.jpg through CC10.jpg)
- Hero image created via AI integration of logo into ceramic photograph

### Phase 2: Initial Website Generation

- Gemini AI tasked with creating responsive site with About, Gallery, Contact sections
- Tailwind CSS styling applied via CDN
- Lightbox gallery implementation based on prior validated code

### Phase 3: Iterative Refinement

- Hero background path corrections
- Logo sizing adjustments
- Gallery aspect-ratio modifications from square to 16/9

### Phase 4: Deployment

- Formspree integrated for contact form handling
- Site hosted on GitHub Pages via Jekyll

## Technical Stack

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Formspree (contact form)
- GitHub Pages

## AI Tools Used

- **GPT-4o** — Logo generation and hero image creation
- **Gemini** — Code generation and iterative refinement

## Reflections

This project demonstrates how AI can accelerate the design and development process when guided by clear human direction. The iterative refinement phase shows that AI-generated code often needs adjustment, but the overall workflow significantly reduced development time.
