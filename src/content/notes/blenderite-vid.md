This is a quick demo of the current state of play of the Blenderite add-on

Here we build the basic medium size studio and the default materials and apply them first to Suzanne (thats the monkey, a standard blender mesh) and then to an imported .glb file.

There is still some work in terms of setting defaults like gizmo and movement.
