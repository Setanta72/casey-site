# Testing

Testing to see if the migration from browser based application to electron based application can work plus the migtation from Raspberry Pi to Mac. 

Classic electron error of right click not working and the image preview didn't load.

Markdown rendering does not appear to be working correctly. 

We've pushed to far and our dreams are china in our hands I fear. 

Next lets see if it can push everything as desired
